I am a fourth-year PhD student in the [Algorithms, Combinatorics, & Optimization (ACO)](https://aco.gatech.edu/) program at Georgia Tech. I did my undergrad in Electrical & Computer Engineering, also at Georgia Tech. 

I am fascinated by the study of intelligence, both biological and artificial. My research on this topic focuses on a few questions:
*   What theoretical models of the brain at the level of neurons can we construct?
*   Can these models replicate the brain's greatest trick (its ability to learn, and especially to learn to reason abstractly)?
*   What can we prove?
*   From this theoretical foundation, can we derive efficient and generalizable machine learning systems?

Outside of research I love music, which is doubtlessly thanks to many years of training in piano performance and composition at the [Suzuki Music Institute of Dallas](https://www.suzukimusicdallas.org/) where I studied with Dr. Bret Serrin. I also enjoy cooking, reading (science fiction & world history in particular), and the great outdoors.

Finally, I organize the ACO Student Seminar. Contact me if you're interested in giving a talk!
