I am a first-year PhD student in the [Algorithms, Combinatorics, & Optimization (ACO)](https://aco.gatech.edu/) program at Georgia Tech. As our understanding of computation deepens, the remarkable connection between computation and the physical world is emerging. Questions like "Can quantum mechanics be (efficiently) simulated on a classic computer?" are not purely academic, but have far-reaching implications, from the security of RSA encryption to the [simulation hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis). For now, I am fascinated by the study of intelligence, both biological and artificial. My research on this topic focuses on a few questions:
*   What theoretical models of the brain at the level of neurons can we construct?
*   Can these models replicate the brain's greatest trick, its ability to learn, and especially to learn to reason abstractly?
*   What can we prove?
*   From this theoretical foundation, can we derive efficient and generalizable machine learning systems?
